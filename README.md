# SWBF2_BotSys
This application lets you add AI Players in Star Wars Battlefront II (2005). The bots will look like normal players and they are customizable.

# UPDATE: BotSystem for SWBF2 is no longer in work and it has been deleted in GitHub. We will no longer provide support for any clients. You can still find the client installers around the internet but we do not recommend them since they cause many issues to the game and they are not verified.


**WARNING: You are allowed to edit and configure this application only for Private purposes. You are not allowed to upload an edited version of this application anywhere. If you think that you fixed some bugs and made some improvements to the original application, then contact me.**


**GUIDE:**
After you launch the *panel.exe* file you will see that a command prompt popped up. From there you can do certain things like, Check for Updates, Re-Install, Factory Reset Application, Backup .dat Files, and Launch with SafeMode. **Check for Updates** option is as simple as the name, the application will check if there are any updates. Most updates size 50MB max. **Re-Install** option is little bit of a complex. You must select the folders that you want to re-install, keep or restore. It may sound easy but It's not since the proccess takes a lot of time. Make sure to use Re-Install as your last option. **Factory Reset Application** is the easiest way to reset all settings of the application, It also deletes addons from other sources. **Launch with SafeMode** option it's rarely needed. It launches the application with all settings to default and without addons. It's mainly used from developers since everyone is allowed to edit it for Pirvate Purposes. You will also see a new line in the prompt that is called **Debug**. This option will show you all analytics for literally everything regarding the application while in-game. Make sure you have a *beefy* computer or else your device might freeze or even crash. The purpose of debug is for developers, to easily find the entity information.



**Known Problems:**
If the prompt disappears in the first milisecond after you opened it, then you have and old version of the application installed on your device. If you can't uninstall it manually then use the panelunis000.exe file.

If the prompt says that there was a critical error, make sure you have your SWBF2 updated to the unofficial patch 1.3 (Make sure you are downloading it from a trusted source).

If the prompt is frozen, then you may have to uninstall unofficial addons.

If the prompt displays a message saying "Unofficial Version Detected, Aborting..." then you installed an edited version from someone else. The official versions are always going to be on my GitHub page. If you find any kind of website that looks official, It's not me. Make sure you always download it from my GitHub because you can also get your device infected with spyware or something.




**Beta Versions:**
All Beta Versions have been removed due to rare use by testers and developers. If you have a Beta executable installer in your device and you want to use it or publish it, you are allowed but I'm not responsible for any damage to your device and I will not provide any support for older versions.
